## SECTION 1: TAM Role in Incident Response

### Your Role During Customer Incidents
As a TAM, you are the customer's advocate and trusted advisor during incidents:
- **Communicate proactively** - Don't wait for customers to ask for updates
- **Coordinate internally** - Bridge between customer and AWS service teams
- **Provide context** - Help service teams understand customer impact
- **Document everything** - Maintain timeline for post-incident review
- **Follow up** - Ensure preventive measures are implemented

### Key Incident Response URLs

- Service Health Dashboard: https://status.aws.amazon.com/
- Support Center: https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/

## SECTION 2: Regional Failover Procedures

### Multi-Region Architecture
For critical workloads, implement multi-region architecture:
- Active-Active: Both regions serve traffic simultaneously
- Active-Passive: Secondary region on standby for failover
- Pilot Light: Minimal resources in secondary, scale up during failover

### Route 53 Health Checks
1. Configure health checks for primary endpoints
2. Set up failover routing policy
3. Define health check thresholds (e.g., 3 failures in 30 seconds)
4. Test failover regularly

### Failover Checklist
- [ ] Verify DNS propagation (TTL considerations)
- [ ] Confirm database replication is current
- [ ] Check application configuration for region-specific settings
- [ ] Validate SSL certificates in failover region
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization systems
- [ ] Verify third-party integrations

## Service Health Dashboard Usage

### AWS Health Dashboard
Access at: https://health.aws.amazon.com/

**Personal Health Dashboard:**
- Shows events affecting YOUR resources
- Provides proactive notifications
- Includes remediation guidance

**Service Health Dashboard:**
- Shows status of all AWS services
- Historical data available
- RSS feeds for monitoring

### Setting Up Health Notifications
1. Go to AWS Health Dashboard
2. Click "Event log" in navigation
3. Configure CloudWatch Events rules for health events
4. Set up SNS notifications for your team

### Interpreting Health Events
- **Open issues**: Currently affecting services
- **Scheduled changes**: Planned maintenance
- **Other notifications**: Informational updates

## Incident Communication Templates

### Initial Customer Communication
```
Subject: [Service Name] - Investigating Reported Issues

Dear Customer,

We are aware of issues affecting [service/region] and are actively investigating.

Current Status: Investigating
Impact: [Brief description of impact]
Start Time: [UTC timestamp]

We will provide updates every [30 minutes/1 hour] until resolution.

Next Update: [Time]
```

### Status Update Template
```
Subject: [Service Name] - Update on Ongoing Issue

Dear Customer,

Update on the [service] issue reported at [time]:

Current Status: [Investigating/Identified/Monitoring/Resolved]
Root Cause: [If identified]
Mitigation: [Actions taken]
ETA for Resolution: [If known]

Workaround: [If available]

Next Update: [Time]
```

### Resolution Communication
```
Subject: [Service Name] - Issue Resolved

Dear Customer,

The issue affecting [service] has been resolved.

Resolution Time: [UTC timestamp]
Duration: [Total time]
Root Cause: [Brief explanation]
Actions Taken: [Summary]

Preventive Measures: [What we're doing to prevent recurrence]

We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
```

## Post-Incident Review Process

### Conducting a Post-Incident Review (PIR)
1. **Timeline Construction**
   - Document all events chronologically
   - Include detection, response, and resolution times
   - Note communication touchpoints

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Use 5 Whys technique
   - Identify contributing factors
   - Distinguish between proximate and root causes

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Number of affected customers
   - Duration of impact
   - Business impact (revenue, SLA)

4. **Action Items**
   - Preventive measures
   - Detection improvements
   - Response process enhancements
   - Assign owners and deadlines

## Common Outage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: EC2 Instance Unreachable
**Symptoms:**
- Cannot SSH/RDP to instance
- Application not responding
- Status checks failing

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check instance status in EC2 console
2. Review system and instance status checks
3. Check security group and NACL rules
4. Verify route table configuration
5. Check if instance is in correct subnet
6. Review CloudWatch metrics for CPU/memory
7. Try stopping and starting instance (not reboot)

### Scenario 2: RDS Database Connection Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Application cannot connect to database
- Connection timeouts
- Authentication failures

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verify RDS instance status
2. Check security group allows inbound traffic
3. Confirm correct endpoint and port
4. Verify credentials and IAM authentication
5. Check if database is in maintenance window
6. Review CloudWatch metrics for connections
7. Check for storage full conditions

### Scenario 3: Lambda Function Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Functions timing out
- Invocation errors
- Throttling

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check CloudWatch Logs for error messages
2. Review function configuration (memory, timeout)
3. Verify IAM role permissions
4. Check for concurrent execution limits
5. Verify VPC configuration if applicable
6. Test with increased memory allocation
7. Check for cold start issues

### Scenario 4: S3 Access Denied
**Symptoms:**
- 403 Forbidden errors
- Access Denied messages
- Bucket policy issues

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verify bucket policy allows access
2. Check IAM user/role permissions
3. Review bucket ACLs
4. Check for S3 Block Public Access settings
5. Verify correct bucket name and region
6. Check for VPC endpoint policies
7. Review AWS Organizations SCPs

## Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate
- Production system down with no workaround
- Security incident suspected
- Data loss or corruption
- SLA breach imminent
- Customer executive escalation

### Escalation Path
1. **Severity 1 (Critical)**: 24/7 support, 15-minute response
2. **Severity 2 (Urgent)**: Business hours, 1-hour response
3. **Severity 3 (High)**: Business hours, 4-hour response
4. **Severity 4 (Normal)**: Business hours, 24-hour response

### Information to Include in Escalation
- Account ID and affected resources
- Timeline of events
- Error messages and logs
- Business impact assessment
- Actions already taken
- Desired outcome
